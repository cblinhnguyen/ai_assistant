## ðŸš€ How to Run the Applications

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Create Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the same directory as `app.py` with the following environment variables:

```env
# Couchbase Configuration
COUCHBASE_CONNSTR=<your_couchbase_connection_string>
COUCHBASE_USERNAME=<your_couchbase_username>
COUCHBASE_PASSWORD=<your_couchbase_password>
COUCHBASE_BUCKET=sales_lead
COUCHBASE_SCOPE=_default
COUCHBASE_COLLECTION=_default

# AWS Bedrock Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_aws_access_key>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_aws_secret_key>
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

#### 4. Deploy and Activate Couchbase Eventing Function
1. Open Couchbase Web Console
2. Navigate to **Eventing** section
3. Deploy the `AI_Assistant.json` eventing function
4. **Activate** the function to enable automatic processing

#### 5. Run the Applications

**Terminal 1 - Flask API Server:**
```bash
python app.py
```
The Flask server will run on `http://localhost:5001`

**Terminal 2 - Streamlit Web Interface:**
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
The Streamlit app will run on `http://localhost:8501`

### Important Notes
- Both applications must be running simultaneously for full functionality
- The Flask API handles the AI processing and Couchbase integration
- The Streamlit app provides the web interface for viewing and managing sales leads
- Ensure the `AI_Assistant.json` eventing function is **activated** in Couchbase for automatic processing
- The eventing function will automatically trigger when sales lead documents are updated in Couchbase

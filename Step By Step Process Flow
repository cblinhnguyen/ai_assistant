Step-by-Step Process Flow
1.	Lead Document Change
o	A sales lead document in Couchbase is created or updated.
2.	Eventing Function Trigger
o	Couchbase Eventing triggers only if old_data exists, to prevent infinite loops.
o	Eventing function builds a payload containing:
	lead_id
	sales_lead (current data)
	old_data (previous values)
3.	Flask Service
o	Receives payload from Eventing.
o	Formats values (e.g., currency, high-priority flags).
o	Generates a natural language prompt for Bedrock.
4.	AWS Bedrock LLM
o	Receives prompt from Flask.
o	Generates:
	Executive Summary (2–3 sentences)
	Recommendation (4–5 actionable bullet points)
5.	Document Update in Couchbase
o	Flask merges the new summary and recommendations with the existing document.
o	Old data is preserved to prevent re-triggering Eventing unnecessarily.
